Release 0.0.1 - Initial clone of BioKanga and renaming application to be kit4b
	This toolkit is a source base clone of 'BioKanga' release 4.4.2 (https://github.com/csiro-crop-informatics/biokanga) and contains
	significant source code changes enabling new functionality and resulting process parameterisation changes. These changes have resulted in
	a backward incompatibilty with 'BioKanga'.

	Because of the potentential for confusion by users unaware of functionality and process parameterisation changes then the modified source base
	and resultant compiled executables have been renamed to 'kit4b' - K-mer Informed Toolkit for Bioinformatics.
	The renaming will force users of the 'BioKanga' toolkit to examine scripting which is dependent on existing 'BioKanga'
	parameterisations so as to make appropriate changes if wishing to utilise 'kit4b' parameterisations and functionality.

	'kit4b' is being released under the Opensource Software License Agreement (GPLv3)
	'kit4b' is Copyright (c) 2020, Please contact Dr Stuart Stephen < stuartjs@g3web.com > if you have any questions regarding 'kit4b'.
Release 0.4.6 - Initial source commit to GitHub as master branch 
Release 0.4.7 - using gitattributes and gitignore to improve chances that respositories will be free of extraneous files/dirs and files have host appropriate line endings
              - slight cosmetic change when reporting list of subprocesses in ngskit4b - removed a tab char in kalign description
Release 0.4.8 - code refactoring, CSimReads read simulation class now part of libkit4b  
Release 0.5.0 - fix for snpmarkers segfault, reduced number of warnings when compiling with gcc 9.2
Release 0.5.1 - fix to allow snpmarkers process continuation if all SNPs are filtered out from a SNP file, removed genmarkers as functionality incorporated within 'ngskit4b snpmarkers'
Release 0.5.2 - initial release of the alignment benchmarking framework - subject to changes!
Release 0.5.3 - now clean compiles, no warnings, with gcc 9.2 on Ubuntu 18.04
Release 0.5.5 - fix for 'ngskit4b snpmarkers -m1' bug (incomplete rows in generated SNP marker file) has been applied
Release 0.5.8 - benchmarking now matured with all functionality implemented
Release 0.5.9 - minimap2 SAM file headers may be missing '@VN' version and sort order line. Fix applied to bypass check for SAM header version line.
Release 0.6.1 - 'ngskit4b benchmark' now has the option to directly generate a CSV file containing benchmarking results
Release 0.6.5 - Refactored CBlitz to be an accessible library component in 'libkit4b'
Release 0.7.0 - 'blitz' throughput performance improvements, 'benchmark' improved scoring of unaligned bases
Release 0.7.1 - 'benchmark' processing now enbles hisat2 PE alignments, improved 'kalign' filtering of very short chimerically trimmed PE reads
Release 0.7.2 - Bugfix (Yes, kit4b does have these!) for di/trisnp calling
Release 0.7.3 - Bugfix (Yes, another! ) for snpmarkers when processing extremely large numbers (billions) of putative SNP loci
Release 0.7.4 - Increased number of species/cultivars/isolates which 'ngskit4b snpm2sql' to be a maximum of 1000
Release 0.7.5 - Blitz improvements enabling improved short K-mer core handling where targeted sequences contain homopolymer repeats of K-mer size
              - Benchmarking better handling of soft/hard clipping alignments whereby some aligners were formerly penalised when mismatch allowances enabled alignments into soft/hardclipped subsequences
Release 0.8.0 - Added an optional preprocessing phase to benchmark enabling limiting number of raw reads to be processed in the mandatory phase 1 alignments
Release 0.8.1 - New processing module added to generate UCSC pgSNP format output from kalign or snpmarkers SNP call format output
Release 0.8.2 - Added support for ouput format VCF 4.1 in addition to existing UCSC pgSNP format when processing kalign or snpmarkers SNP calls by snps2pgsnps
Release 0.9.0 - Added support for set operations (union,intersect,complement union, complement intersect, subtract) to snps2pgsnps
Release 0.9.5 - New processing module, lochap2bed, added by which localised haplotypes detected by kalign (disnp and trisnp alleles) can be output as a UCSC BED format file
Release 0.9.6 - Spelling corrections in copyright notices - no functional code changes
Release 0.9.7 - Increased number of cultivars that can be processed by snpmarkers upto a maximum of 4000 (was 1000); kalign now uses a floor of 0.005 (was 0.01) for background substitution rates when SNP calling
Release 0.9.8 - Snpmarkers carries through background substitution rates from kalign instead of generating it's own score - this is to allow down stream processing applications to recalculate P-values on allelic variations at the SNP sites - required for SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape analysis when processing for inter-isolate allelic variations. 
Release 0.9.10- snps2pgsnps can now also generate summary SNP distributions
Release 0.9.12- kalign generates extended SNP CSV formated files containing codon frameshifted distributions; snps2pgsnps can now utilise extended SNP CSVs and a GTF feature file for summary output of synonymous/non-synonymous/wobble codon distributions
Release 1.0.0 - Extended codon and SNP site peptide mixture summary reporting by snps2pgsnps
Release 1.0.1 - snps2pgsnps can now generate extended codon and SNP site peptide mixture summary reporting for individual readsets as well as the summary over all readsets 
Release 1.1.0 - snps2pgsnps now generates additional extended summaries including readset scored similarities     
Release 1.1.3 - GCC source updated to now using clock_gettime() as former ftime() deemed deprecated by recent releases of GCC
Release 1.2.0 - Initial pangenome support release utilising assembly sequence name prefixes and filtering of SAM alignments for aligments to prefixed sequences
Release 1.2.2 - Improved pangenome input file type checking - input chars must be ascii only
