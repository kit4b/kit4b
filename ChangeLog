Release 0.0.1 - Initial clone of BioKanga and renaming application to be kit4b
	This toolkit is a source base clone of 'BioKanga' release 4.4.2 (https://github.com/csiro-crop-informatics/biokanga) and contains
	significant source code changes enabling new functionality and resulting process parameterisation changes. These changes have resulted in
	a backward incompatibilty with 'BioKanga'.

	Because of the potentential for confusion by users unaware of functionality and process parameterisation changes then the modified source base
	and resultant compiled executables have been renamed to 'kit4b' - K-mer Informed Toolkit for Bioinformatics.
	The renaming will force users of the 'BioKanga' toolkit to examine scripting which is dependent on existing 'BioKanga'
	parameterisations so as to make appropriate changes if wishing to utilise 'kit4b' parameterisations and functionality.

	'kit4b' is being released under the Opensource Software License Agreement (GPLv3)
	'kit4b' is Copyright (c) 2020, Please contact Dr Stuart Stephen < stuartjs@g3web.com > if you have any questions regarding 'kit4b'.

Release 0.7.5 - Blitz improvements enabling improved short K-mer core handling where targeted sequences contain homopolymer repeats of K-mer size
              - Benchmarking better handling of soft/hard clipping alignments whereby some aligners were formerly penalised when mismatch allowances enabled alignments into soft/hardclipped subsequences

Release 1.3.0 - New processing module 'seghaplotypes' which takes SAM/BAM alignments to a pangenome and reports in BED format haplotype segmentations
Release 1.3.2 - 'hammings' now has functionality to generate founder specific hammings from a pan-genomic suffix array
Release 1.3.3 - 'sarscov2ml' mutation linkage reporting now implemented

Release 1.4.0 - 'seghaplotypes' can now differentiate inter and intra haplotype segments
Release 1.4.1 - 'sarscov2ml' is now multithreaded enabling substantial throughput improvements
Release 1.4.3 - Option added whereby 'seghaplotypes' can split output into separate files for each tagged founder haplotype
Release 1.4.5 - 'kalign' generates a scored reads alignment coverage BED file when SNPs are called. 'repassemb' can use this BED file and mark regions in the repurposed assembly which were not covered by reads as being indeterminate preventing subsequent alignments to these regions.
Release 1.4.7 - 'repassemb' terminates if unable to locate specified alignment coverage BED file
Release 1.5.0 - 'snpmarkers' now has option to filter out marker loci which are not heterozygous between all cultivars, and 'seghaplotypes' can use these marker loci to boost identified haplotype segment scores.

Release 1.6.5 - 'kalign' can now align pooled readsets (multiple readsets treated as if reads from a single set) up to a maximum of 16,000 PE readsets. Immediate application has been for mutational trend discovery in SARS-CoV-2 readsets.
Release 1.7.0 - General code cleanup and optimisations.
Release 1.7.7 - 'callhaplotypes' refactored to report each haplotype loci instead of the original (Release 1.7.0) counts of haplotypes within a fixed sized window. 
Release 1.8.0 - 'callhaplotypes' now supports haplotype group clustering.
Release 1.8.1 - 'callhaplotypes' additionally supports regional overlapping haplotype group clustering with differential region sizes and centroid clustering distance metrics.

Release 1.9.8 - 'callhaplotypes' effectively removes requirement to hold all complete targeted PBA assemblies (could be thousands) in available memory, assemblies are now processed by iteratively loading single chromosomes from all assemblies and dicarding each chromosome on processing completion.
Release 1.9.9 - General code cleanup and optimisations
Release 1.9.10- Fix for reporting platform independent 64bit values, now using the '-zd' type specifier with casts to (size_t) in sprintf output format strings.
Release 1.10.0- Further code cleanups - reduction is function stack frame size requirements and, Ubuntu gcc/g++ 11.2.0 only observed as required, small 2 sec wait() between pthread_create() and testing thread initialisation with pthread_timedjoin_np().
