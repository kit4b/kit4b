Release 0.0.1 - Initial clone of BioKanga and renaming application to be kit4b
	This toolkit is a source base clone of 'BioKanga' release 4.4.2 (https://github.com/csiro-crop-informatics/biokanga) and contains
	significant source code changes enabling new functionality and resulting process parameterisation changes. These changes have resulted in
	a backward incompatibilty with 'BioKanga'.

	Because of the potentential for confusion by users unaware of functionality and process parameterisation changes then the modified source base
	and resultant compiled executables have been renamed to 'kit4b' - K-mer Informed Toolkit for Bioinformatics.
	The renaming will force users of the 'BioKanga' toolkit to examine scripting which is dependent on existing 'BioKanga'
	parameterisations so as to make appropriate changes if wishing to utilise 'kit4b' parameterisations and functionality.

	'kit4b' is being released under the Opensource Software License Agreement (GPLv3)
	'kit4b' is Copyright (c) 2020, Please contact Dr Stuart Stephen < stuartjs@g3web.com > if you have any questions regarding 'kit4b'.
Release 0.4.6 - Initial source commit to GitHub as master branch 
Release 0.4.7 - using gitattributes and gitignore to improve chances that respositories will be free of extraneous files/dirs and files have host appropriate line endings
              - slight cosmetic change when reporting list of subprocesses in ngskit4b - removed a tab char in kalign description
Release 0.4.8 - code refactoring, CSimReads read simulation class now part of libkit4b  
Release 0.5.0 - fix for snpmarkers segfault, reduced number of warnings when compiling with gcc 9.2
Release 0.5.1 - fix to allow snpmarkers process continuation if all SNPs are filtered out from a SNP file, removed genmarkers as functionality incorporated within 'ngskit4b snpmarkers'
Release 0.5.2 - initial release of the alignment benchmarking framework - subject to changes!
Release 0.5.3 - now clean compiles, no warnings, with gcc 9.2 on Ubuntu 18.04
Release 0.5.5 - fix for 'ngskit4b snpmarkers -m1' bug (incomplete rows in generated SNP marker file) has been applied
Release 0.5.8 - benchmarking now matured with all functionality implemented
