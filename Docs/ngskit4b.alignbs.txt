Version 0.4.6
===========================
Released January 16th 2020


-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the ngskit4b build version and then
	terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-q, --sumrslts=<file>     
	Output results summary to this SQLite3 database file

-w, --experimentname=<str> 
	experiment name SQLite3 database file

-W, --experimentdescr=<str> 
	experiment description SQLite3 database file

-m, --mode=<int>
	bootstrap processing mode: 
		0 - standard
		1 - report bootstrap sequences used in each iteration

-r, --randseed=<int>
	if > 0 then random generator seed, otherwise current time used as the seed (default 0)

-a, --senseonly
	align sense only, default is to align both sense and antisense

-s, --maxsubs=<int>
	allowing at most this many subs as percentage of query length before accepting alignment (default 0, range 0..50

-b, --numbootstraps=<int>
	number of bootstrap iterations - excluding initial original query seqs aligned to original target seqs (default 1000, range 1..10000)

-x, --woreplacement
	sample without replacement, default is to sample with replacement

-X, --nooverlaps
	sample without overlap, default is to sample allowing overlaps

-p, --queryseqsfile=<file>
	fasta file containing initial query sequences from which to derive query length distributions

-P, --queryassembfile=<file>
	file containing fasta assembly to be bootstrap sampled for query sequences with same length distributions as sequences in queryseqsfile

-i, --targseqsfile=<file>
	fasta file containing initial target sequences from which to derive target length distributions

-I, --targassembfile=<file>
	file containing fasta assembly to be bootstrap sampled for target sequences with same length distributions as sequences in targassembfile

-o, --qrsltsfile=<file>
	summary number of query hits onto at least one target bootstrap results to this file

-O, --trsltsfile=<file>
	summary number of targets hit by at least one query bootstrap results to this file

-T, --threads=<int>
	number of processing threads 0..128 (defaults to 0 which sets threads to number of CPU cores)


Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option paramter file to the ngskit4b toolkit
components then precede its name with '@' - ngskit4b alignbs @myparams.txt
