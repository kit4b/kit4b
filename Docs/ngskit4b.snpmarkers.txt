Released January 16th 2020


 -h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the ngskit4b build version and then
	terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-q, --sumrslts=<file>
	Output results summary to this SQLite3 database file

-w, --experimentname=<str>
        Specifies experiment name to use in SQLite3 database file

-W, --experimentdescr=<str>
	Specifies experiment description to use in SQLite3 database file

-m, --mode=<int>
        Marker reporting mode: 0 - SNP markers if either inter-species/cultivar or relative to reference
                               1 - report SNP markers only if inter-species/cultivar differences

-b, --mincovbases=<int>
	Filter out SNPs with less than this number of covering bases, default 5

-p, --maxpvalue=<dbl>
	Filter out SNPs with P-Value higher, default 0.05

-P, --snpmajorpc=<dbl>
	Filter out SNPs with major SNP base less than this percentage of
	total, defaults to 50%, range 15 to 90%

-z, --mintotcntthres=<int>
	Species must have at least this number of total bases covering
	marker loci (defaults to 0 which means no threshold is applied)

-a, --altspeciesmaxcnt=<int>
	Only report markers if no other species has more than this number of
	counts at the putative SNP loci (defaults to 0 meaning no threshold is applied)

-Z, --mincovspecies=<int>
	Do not report markers unless this minimum number of species have SNP
	at same loci

-r, --refgenome=<str>
	Alignments and SNPs of relative genomes were against this genome
	assembly (default 'RefGenome')

-R, --relgenomes=<relgenomes>
	Alignments and SNPs from these genomes

-i, --insnps=<file>
	Load SNPs from file(s)

-I, --inaligns=<file>
	Load alignments from file(s)

-o, --out=<file>
	Output marker SNP loci to this file


Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option paramter file to the ngskit4b toolkit
components then precede its name with '@', e.g. ngskit4b snpmarkers @myparams.txt
