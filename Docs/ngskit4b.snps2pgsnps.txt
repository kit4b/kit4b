ngskit4b snps2pgsnps
Process kalign or snpmarkers SNP calls into UCSC Personal Genenome SNP
format ready for display in the UCSC Genome Browser.
Set operations are now supported. Provide a list of cultivar names which
are in SetA and another list of names in SetB. Then union, intersect, subtraction,
complement union, complement intersect Set operations will be processed.


Version 1.0.1
===========================
Released June 9th 2020


This subprocess can be used to take the SNP CSV formated files generated
by 'ngskit4b kalign' or 'ngskit4b snpmarkers' and convert these into
pgSNP format files ready for displaying in the UCSC Genome Browser.
Parameterisation is provided whereby PValue and loci coverage required
can be specified by the user to further constrain which SNP alleles are
accepted over those accepted by 'kalign' or 'snpmarkers'. 
Additionally a summary report containing codon/peptide useage at SNP sites 
can now be generated. This new feature requires kalign extended SNP CSV files
to have been generated which contain codon frame shift counts at SNP loci. 
Feature CDS start/stop must also be specified in GTF format to snps2pgsnps.
This new functionality is currently only targeting gRNA or gDNA virus scaled 
genomes having limited numbers (100 max) of CDS features which are on the sense
strand only.  

-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the application build version and then terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-m, --mode=<int>
Processing mode: 
	0: input (-i, --insnps=<file>) is from kalign SNP calls
	1: input (-i, --insnps=<file>) is from snpmarkers calls

-p, --pvalue=<dbl>
	SNP maximum allele PValue threshold (default 0.05, range 0.01..0.25)

-P, --minalleleprop=<dbl> 
	SNP minimum allele proportion of loci site coverage (default 0.1, range 0.01..0.95)

-c, --mincoverage=<int>   
	SNP minimum loci site coverage (default 20, range 5..10000)

-i, --insnps=<file>       
	Input called SNPs or snpmarkers from this kalign or snpmarkers generated CSV file
	In processing mode 0 - kalign SNP calls - then wildcards can be used in the filename specification

-g, --gtf=<file>
	Only used in processing mode 0 - input from kalign SNP CSV calls
	Input transcriptomic features from this virus GTF file
	intended for use with viral gRNA genomes only 
	WARNING: targeting sense strand only transcripts, with a max of 100 CDS features

-o, --outpgsnps=<file>
	By default, output in UCSC pgSNP format to this file
	If file extension is '.vcf' then output format will be in VCF 4.1
	If file extension is '.csv' in processing mode 0 - kalign SNP calls -
	then individual readset SNP transcriptomic features will be generated into this file

-V, --setop=<int>
	SetA/B operator -
		0: none, 
		1: (A union B) 
		2: (A intersect B)
		3: complement of (A union B)
		4: complement of (A intersect B)
		5: (A subtract B)

-s, --seta=<seta>
	name of snpmarkers species/cultivar/strain in SetA

-S, --setb=<setb>
	name of snpmarkers species/cultivar/strain in SeB

-e, --experiment=<str>
	UCSC pgSNP experiment description

-a, --assembly=<str>
	UCSC assembly name

-t, --track=<str>
	UCSC track name

Note: Parameters can be entered into a parameter file, one parameter per line.
      To invoke this parameter file then precede its name with '@'
      e.g. ngskit4b snps2pgsnps @myparams.txt


Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option paramter file to the ngskit4b toolkit
components then precede its name with '@', e.g. ngskit4b snps2pgsnps @myparams.txt
