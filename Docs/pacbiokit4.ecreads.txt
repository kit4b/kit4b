Options ---

-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the

	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the kit4b build version and then
	terminates

        (default 14, range 12 to 50)

Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option parameter file to the kit4bpacbio toolkit
components then precede its name with '@', e.g. kit4bpacbio ecreads @myparams.txt
