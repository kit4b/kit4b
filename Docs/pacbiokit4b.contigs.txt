=======================
Released January 16th 2020

Options ---

-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the kit4b build version and then
	terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-q, --sumrslts=<file>
	Output results summary to this SQLite3 database file

-w, --experimentname=<str>
        Specifies experiment name to use in SQLite3 database file

-W, --experimentdescr=<str>
	Specifies experiment description to use in SQLite3 database file

-m, --pmode=<int>         
        Processing mode: 
        0 - use pregenerated overlap loci details file and error corrected sequences
        1 - generate GEXF output format
        2 - generate GraphML output format

-l, --minscafflen=<int>
        Minimum individual sequence length (default 5000, range 500 to 100000)

-L, --minscaffovl=<int>
        Minimum overlap required to merge reads into single contig (default 5000, range 250 to 100000)

-s, --min1kscore=<int>
        Minimum normalised 1Kbp overlap score required (default 980, range 800 to 1000)

-S, --orphanseqs
        Accept orphan sequences not overlapped by any other sequence

-a, --senseonlyovlps
        Accepting sense only overlaps (default is to accept both sense/antisense and sense/sense)

-I, --pacbiosovlps=<file>
        Input file containing pregenerated error corrected overlap detail

-i, --pacbiofile=<file>
        Names of input files containing error corrected sequences to be used for contigs

-o, --out=<file>
        Output merged contig sequences (processing mode 0) or GEFX or GraphML format to this file

-T, --threads=<int>
        Number of processing threads 0..128 (defaults to 0 which sets threads to number of CPU cores)

Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option parameter file to the pacbiokit4b toolkit
components then precede its name with '@', e.g. pacbiokit4b contigs @myparams.txt
