/*
This toolkit is a source base clone of 'BioKanga' release 4.4.2 (https://github.com/csiro-crop-informatics/biokanga) and contains
significant source code changes enabling new functionality and resulting process parameterisation changes. These changes have resulted in
incompatibilty with 'BioKanga'.

Because of the potentential for confusion by users unaware of functionality and process parameterisation changes then the modified source base
and resultant compiled executables have been renamed to 'kit4b' - K-mer Informed Toolkit for Bioinformatics.
The renaming will force users of the 'BioKanga' toolkit to examine scripting which is dependent on existing 'BioKanga'
parameterisations so as to make appropriate changes if wishing to utilise 'kit4b' parameterisations and functionality.

'kit4b' is being released under the Opensource Software License Agreement (GPLv3)
'kit4b' is Copyright (c) 2019, 2020
Please contact Dr Stuart Stephen < stuartjs@g3web.com > if you have any questions regarding 'kit4b'.
