/*
This toolkit is a source base clone of 'BioKanga' release 4.4.2 (https://github.com/csiro-crop-informatics/biokanga) and contains
significant source code changes enabling new functionality and resulting process parameterisation changes. These changes have resulted in
incompatibility with 'BioKanga'.

Because of the potential for confusion by users unaware of functionality and process parameterisation changes then the modified source base
and resultant compiled executables have been renamed to 'kit4b' - K-mer Informed Toolkit for Bioinformatics.
The renaming will force users of the 'BioKanga' toolkit to examine scripting which is dependent on existing 'BioKanga'
parameterisations so as to make appropriate changes if wishing to utilise 'kit4b' parameterisations and functionality.
